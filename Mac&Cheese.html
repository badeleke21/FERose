    <h3 class="header3"> Step 1: Cook the Macaroni</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Boil the Macaroni till aldente. The package should say how long to cook the macaroni for. Keep in mind you are also going to stick this in the oven to cook longer. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="header3">Step 2: Make the cheese sauce</h3>
    <p>
        In a large saucepan, melt the butter over low to medium heat. Slowly stir in the flour, salt, pepper, mustard powder, onion powder, and garlic powder until this is all mixed in well with no lumps. Lightly brown this creating a roux like consistency and texture. 
        Gradually whisk the milk into this rough as well, mix it well and make sure there are no lumps in this mixture.
        Reduce the heat to low if its medium and slowly add the sharp cheddar and grated parmesan cheese. Save extra to add to the oven mixture. Stir until the cheese is completed melted and mixed in well with the sauce. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="header3"> Add the Macaroni</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Step 3: Add the Mac to the cheese sauce.
        In an oven safe pan add the mac and the cheese together. Fold the remaining cheese in the pan and preheet the oven to 250 degrees. Spinkle the remaining cheese on the rest of the dish and pop in the oven for 5-10 minutes or until the cheese is full melted and golden brown.
