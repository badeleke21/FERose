    <h2 class="header2"> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="squaredots"> 
        <li> 2lbs of potatoes (russet or yukon gold)</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li> 1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li> salt to taste</li>
        <li> Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header3">Prep work</h3>
    <p> Start by washing and peeling your potatoes. Cut these potatoes into cubes so they don't take as long to boil. In a large pot start boiling water and salt it just a smidge. Wait until the water reaches a boil and add in your potatoes. 
        Let the potatoes boil for for about 15-20 minutes or until soft and tender. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="header3"> Drain and Mash</h3>
    <p class="parapgraph"> Drain the potatoes after they have finished boiling and return them to the pot to mash the potatoes. You can use a masher and mash them up until most of the lumps are gone.
        In a small saucepan melt the butter and then add this butter to the mashed potatoes in the large pot. Fold in slowly and mix the butter in with the mashed potatoes with the masher. 
        Gradually add in the milk slowly. You do not have to use all of the milk, mix as much as you favor until you get your desired consistency for your preference. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="header3"> Seasoning</h3>
    <p>The salt and pepper are optional, incorporate as you feel the need to.</p>
