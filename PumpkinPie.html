        <li> 1 can of evaporated milk</li>
       </ul>
    <h3 class="header3">Preheat</h3>
       <p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees</p>
    <h3 class="header3"> Prepare Filling</h3>
    <p> 
        In a large bowl mix together the pumpkin puree, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Slowly beat the eggs into the mixture one egg at time. After this egg is beaten in with the pumpkin and spice mixture, slowly add in the evaporatd milk. Mix all of this together until the mix is smooth and lump free. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="header3"> Fill the crust</h3>
    <p> After unwrapping the crust, pour your pumpkin mixture into your premade crust. </p>
    <h3> Bake the pie</h3>
    <p>
        The oven should be 425 degrees by now, bake the pie in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes. Reduce this heat to 350 degrees and continue baking the rest of the pie for 40-50 minutes. You will know your pie is done when you insert a knife in the middle and the blade comes out clean. 
    </p>
    <h3 class="header3"> Cool and serve</h3>
    <p> Allow the pie to cool completely before serving. This dish is best served with a hearty dallop of cool whip or whip cream. </p>
